# Lab1-Portfolio

### Basic HTML programming expertise is an important skill for Computer Science graduates.  

##### In creating a web page you can think of the *Content Layer* as being the basic HTML. The *Presentation Layer* is the CSS, and the *Behavior Layer* as the javascript.

##### For this assignment, you'll need to create a web page portfolio that will showcase the different projects you have/will done. You can look at [freecodecamp portfolio project](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-personal-portfolio-webpage) for an example of a portfolio, but you can do something much simpler. A major part of the assignment is to make your page look good, so make sure to spend some time on that.

### A portfolio should (and yours must) include at least the following sections defined in your index.html file in this repository:
- A brief about section (similar to a resume objective statement but with more information about you)
- Projects (include at least 3, even if they're super simple HTML pages)
- A work experience section (This would be a good place for your lists)
- Links to sites like github and linkedin where someone could learn more

### Your page should have at least the following specific elements:

- lists (Ordered and Unordered with at least 2 items)
- different background colors for different sections (not each piece, but like header/footer/main content/etc)
- images (at least 2)
- links to other pages (at least the two above)
- heading styles that are defined in your CSS (in the file main.css provided in this repository)

### Your Page must also include:
- some basic DOM manipulation with JavaScript (like find an HTML element and change its color with a button to something else, or whatever you can find - try checking this <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom.asp">tutorial</a>)
